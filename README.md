# The-Mathematical-Contest-in-Modeling-2024
This is the Math Modeling contest that I attended with friends, representing Swarthmore Collge.
The contest need to be accomplished in 96 hours. The outcome should be a complete mathematical model and a 25 page long academic paper. In the contest, we modelled the player's and the match's momentum in tennis. We took files from the 2023 Wimbledon match, processed data, analyzed the data using Machine Learning Logistic Regressions, Pearson Coefficient Test, and Random Forest Algorithm to product a quantitative model for momentum and a predicition model for momentum swings and runs of success. The results were compiled into a 25 page long academic paper.
